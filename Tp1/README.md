# TP 1
We have three data files: 
- people.json: a file with people information and their ip addresses
- btc_address.json: a file with bitcoin addresses and the country of their owner
- fav_stock.xml: a file that links first names with favorite stocks. 

With this data, we will find out:
- which bitcoin addresses could potentially belong to who (by linking ip addresses and countries)
- what are the favorite stocks of people based on the fav_stock data



## How to run the code
1. install the requirements (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)
2. run `tp1.py` (`python3 tp1.py`)
